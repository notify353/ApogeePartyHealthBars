# Apogee Party Health Bars

Compact five-player healing frames for World of Warcraft Anniversary and Burning Crusade Classic.

## Features

- Player and party health, power, shields, incoming heals, HoTs, and threat
- Selectable sound and threshold when the player or a party member drops low on health
- Inline unit targets and target-of-target health
- Secure click-casting and clickable buff reminders
- Player spell and crowd-control tracking
- Editable mouse-wheel macros with six manually configured spell slots
- Missing party-buff and self-buff reminders
- Class-aware macro library
- Movable minimap button and tabbed settings

## Install

Use [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/apogee-party-health-bars) or download the packaged ZIP from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/notify353/ApogeePartyHealthBars/releases).

Do not use GitHub's **Code -> Download ZIP** archive. A valid installation has this path:

```text
Interface/AddOns/ApogeePartyHealthBars/ApogeePartyHealthBars.toc
```

## Use

Left-click the minimap button to open settings; the Spellbook opens alongside it. Shift-click a spell when assigning click bindings, tracker slots, or wheel display spells. Secure changes may wait until combat ends.

The Wheel tab configures six normal gameplay macros for scroll up/down with no modifier, Shift, or Ctrl. Enabling Wheel reserves all six keys as blank no-ops. Each talent spec has an independent Wheel profile that follows the equipped spec automatically; a newly activated second spec starts empty, while Wheel enablement and key ownership remain character-wide. Characters with stances or forms reported by the client receive a complete six-slot layout for each known state; classes with a valid no-form state also receive a Base layout, while Warriors see only Battle, Defensive, and Berserker Stance. The active layout switches automatically, including during combat. Classes without stances see the original single-layout editor. Shift-click a Spellbook spell to configure a slot in the selected layout, edit its macro if needed, then select Save. Saving a blank macro clears that layout's slot. Wheel macros use normal WoW targeting and are separate from health-bar mouseover click bindings.

The General tab includes a Factory Reset control for restoring wheel keys, clearing account and current-character add-on settings, and reloading through the first-run initialization path.

## Develop

### Set up a development checkout on Windows

The repository is the development copy; cloning or downloading it does not automatically place it in WoW's add-on directory. Keep the repository outside the WoW installation and create a Windows directory junction so WoW loads the same files you edit.

1. Install the Anniversary client and [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
2. Clone the repository to a normal development directory:

   ```powershell
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path C:\Dev\WoW -Force
   Set-Location C:\Dev\WoW
   git clone https://github.com/notify353/ApogeePartyHealthBars.git
   Set-Location ApogeePartyHealthBars
   ```

3. Close WoW. Open PowerShell as Administrator and create the junction below. Change `$Repo` or `$WoW` first if either location is different on your computer.

   ```powershell
   $Repo = (Resolve-Path 'C:\Dev\WoW\ApogeePartyHealthBars').Path
   $WoW = 'C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_anniversary_'
   $AddOns = Join-Path $WoW 'Interface\AddOns'
   $Link = Join-Path $AddOns 'ApogeePartyHealthBars'

   if (Test-Path -LiteralPath $Link) {
       throw "The add-on path already exists: $Link. Back it up or remove it intentionally before continuing."
   }

   New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path $Link -Target $Repo
   ```

   Do not initialize another Git repository inside the WoW directory, copy the development repository there, or replace an existing path without first checking whether it contains files you need.

4. Verify the junction and TOC from the same PowerShell window:

   ```powershell
   Get-Item -LiteralPath $Link | Select-Object FullName, LinkType, Target
   Test-Path -LiteralPath (Join-Path $Link 'ApogeePartyHealthBars.toc')
   ```

   `LinkType` must be `Junction`, `Target` must be the development repository, and `Test-Path` must return `True`. WoW now sees repository edits immediately; use `/reload` after ordinary source changes. Secure-frame or initialization changes may require logging out or restarting the client.

### Install development prerequisites and validate

From an elevated PowerShell, install Lua for Windows 5.1.5. Restart PowerShell so the updated `PATH` is available, then run the complete local validation suite from the repository:

```powershell
winget install --id rjpcomputing.luaforwindows --exact --version 5.1.5.52
pwsh ./scripts/test-local.ps1
```

The runner rejects other Lua versions, parses every add-on source file, runs every Lua specification, validates the package and release workflow, builds and inspects a local ZIP, and checks the Git diff for whitespace errors.

The matching local Blizzard interface export is the primary development reference for WoW APIs and interface behavior. Read [docs/WOW_INTERFACE_EXPORT.md](docs/WOW_INTERFACE_EXPORT.md) before API-dependent work. The validation suite fails when the installed Anniversary client is newer than the recorded export and explains how to refresh it.

## Compatibility

Current target: Anniversary/Burning Crusade Classic 2.5.6, TOC interface `20506`. Retail and other Classic clients are unsupported.

## Support
